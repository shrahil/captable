Detailed Findings
Essential Features for Basic Equity Management Software
Based on the analysis, the following features are essential for a very basic equity management software:

Cap Table Management:
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for shareholders, allowing founders to add new investors or employees and update ownership details.
Support for different share classes (e.g., common, preferred) to handle various equity instruments.
Automatic calculation of ownership percentages to ensure accuracy and transparency.
Stock Option Management:
Issue new stock options with details like grant date, exercise price, and vesting schedule, enabling HR to manage ESOPs effectively.
Track vested and unvested options, including handling exercises and cancellations, to monitor employee equity stakes.
Support for common vesting terms, such as a 4-year vest with a 1-year cliff, to align with industry practices.
Vesting Schedules:
Define vesting terms and automatically calculate vested amounts based on time, simplifying administration for HR.
Provide visibility into upcoming vesting events to help employees understand their equity progression.
Basic Reporting:
Generate cap table reports showing all shareholders and their ownership percentages, useful for investor updates and board meetings.
Option grant reports listing all granted options with details like grant date and vesting status, aiding in compliance and transparency.
Vesting schedule reports showing upcoming vesting events, helping admins plan and communicate with employees.
User Management:
Role-based access control, with admins able to manage all data and employees restricted to viewing their own option details, ensuring data security.
Secure login with password protection, and the ability to invite new users via email, simplifying onboarding.
Self-Hosting Capabilities:
Easy installation on a server with clear instructions, minimizing technical barriers for founders.
Support for common databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, which are widely available and open-source.
Use of Docker containers for deployment, ensuring compatibility with various server environments and simplifying setup.
These features align with the needs of a Series A company, focusing on simplicity and essential functionality while avoiding complex compliance features like 409A valuations, which are out of scope for this basic software.

User Stories and Usability
To ensure the software meets user needs, the following user stories were developed:

As a founder, I want to add new shareholders and update their ownership percentages so that I can keep track of who owns what in the company, ensuring accurate records for fundraising and investor relations.
As an HR manager, I want to issue stock options to new employees and set their vesting schedules so that I can manage equity compensation effectively, aligning with company retention strategies.
As an employee, I want to view my stock option details and vesting progress so that I can understand my equity stake, fostering engagement and ownership.
As an admin, I want to generate reports on cap table and option grants so that I can provide transparency to investors and board members, supporting compliance and decision-making.
The software should have an intuitive user interface, with clear navigation and minimal technical expertise required, ensuring usability for non-technical users like founders and HR personnel.

Non-Functional Requirements
To ensure the software is reliable and secure, the following non-functional requirements were identified:

Security: Data encryption for sensitive information, secure authentication (e.g., username/password or OAuth), and role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.
Usability: An intuitive interface with easy navigation, minimizing the learning curve for users.
Performance: Fast response times for typical usage scenarios, such as viewing reports or updating records, to ensure efficiency.
Scalability: Able to handle up to 100 shareholders and 500 option grants without performance issues, suitable for early-stage growth.
These requirements ensure the software is practical for small teams while maintaining data integrity and user satisfaction.

Technical Requirements for Self-Hosting
Given the self-hosting requirement, the following technical specifications were outlined:

Technology Stack: A web-based application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Python (e.g., Django/Flask) or Node.js (e.g., Express.js) for the backend, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
Database: Support for MySQL or PostgreSQL, both open-source and widely used, to minimize costs and simplify maintenance.
Deployment: Use Docker containers for easy deployment, allowing the software to run on any server with Docker installed, reducing setup complexity.
Dependencies: Minimize external libraries, prioritizing open-source solutions to reduce maintenance overhead and ensure long-term sustainability.
These technical requirements ensure the software can be easily installed and maintained on a companyâ€™s own server, aligning with the goal of data privacy and control.
